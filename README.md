I am a former Senior Analyst who worked with decision-making systems for credit institutions. I got acquainted with Data Science in practice when I was asked to develop a service for customers with functions for face recognition and matching, text recognition, etc. in the same position. This microservice helped customers make more precise decisions and increased the speed of checking photos and extracting information from photos by about 5 times. After the development, improvement, and support of this service, I realized that in the future I would like to do Data Science. Realizing that I have gaps and shortcomings in my knowledge after leaving my previous company, I devoted all my time to professional development in this way at Data Science online school karpov.courses, completing courses which are associated with: Data Analysis and ML engineering. I am currently studying karpov.courses ML Simulator, which allows me to practice machine learning tasks, and looking for a new job as a Data Scientist.
